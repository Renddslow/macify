# Macify
You know all those frustrating test plans that you get that are in Windows file format and then you have to try to hunt them down on the omaha drive?

Well hunt no longer! With Macify all you have to do is copy and paste the link into your terminal and we'll take care of the rest.

## Getting started
```
git clone https://github.com/Renddslow/macify.git
cd macify
npm i -g
macify "J:\Some\Crazy\Windows URL That\Has\Space.docx"
```

*Important note:* The Windows file path must be contained within quotes due to the spaces that often come with Windows file paths.
